It should have the goal of making this look prettier - maybe making it look like a business card that a professional might hand out at a networking event. -->

In class, you learned about how to put a file on puff.mnstate.edu and the various directories that are set up for you within there.

You are to put this there on puff.mnstate.edu at the following path:

/home/StarID/public_html/private/module01assign01

Where &#34;StarID&#34; should be replaced with your Star ID.

Then, as indicated in class, you should be able to access it, using a web browser on campus, using the following URL:

http://puff.mnstate.edu/~StarID/private/module01assign01

In order to do so, you&#39;ll need to log in using your MySQL username and password, which you can utilize the resources there in the &#34;Class Mechanics&#34; section of D2L Brightspace to help you figure out/adjust/reset as needed.
