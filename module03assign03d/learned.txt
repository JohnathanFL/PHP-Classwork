Time Taken: ~4.01 hours
Learned:
- The `for` in a label attribute refers to the ID for a radio button, but that and the name
  don't have to be the same.
- Learned that PHP's real prickly about int-like strings, especially where maps are concerned
- Learned about mucking with ini settings (for changing the syntax highlighting to work with my 
  Nord theme)
- That PHP's Date library is weird
- Why PHP is so feared
- The DateTime setDate method wraps its inputs around, so Feb-31 will parse
  as 03-02. This is very annoying.
